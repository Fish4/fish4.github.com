<h1> Space Ship Strategy Combat Game </h1>

<h3> - With Simultaneous Element! </h3>

<p>
	For example, here is a simple hexagon grid layout:
</p>

<canvas id="hexmap" width="660" height="624"></canvas>
<script src="../assets/js/hexagongrid.js"></script>

<p>
	The whole point of the game is to anticipate enemy move and in advance, take down enemy ships without any cost!
