Based on my previous work with the Source engine and the complaints that I've seen online that Valve's Hammer Editor was severely outdated, I started UDK expecting something significantly more advanced. While I only lightly grazed the surface of what is most certainly a very complicated enginge, it feels very similar to my experiences with the Source engine. What does this mean? In my eyes it tells me that the Unreal Engine will almost certainly be a bad fit for our plans of a Third Person Simultaneous Strategy Game. The initial appeal of the Unreal Engine was in its wide array of tools, vast amounts of documentation, and an engine that will handle a great deal of work for us. As a result of these findings, my suggestion is that we change the engine to Unity, which was our second choice from the last meeting.
